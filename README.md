# ./main.cpp

Compiling and running C++ code is confusing. Why can't you just execute the source code directly? It works in Python!

I once saw someone try to run some C++ code by executing `./main.cpp`. I was shocked and disappointed at first, but ultimately I was inspired! The question is, could that work? In essence, is it possible to make something both a valid bash script, and also valid c++ code? I took this idea way to far, and you have what you have what you see here.

# Prove that it works

Just clone this repository and run `./examples/minimal/main.cpp`! This assumes you have the apt package manager and are using the bash shell. Other shells may work but I haven't tested.

There's a lot of other stuff in this repository from the rest of [my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72gTYLnWnLg). Apoligies in advance for the super low video quality.
